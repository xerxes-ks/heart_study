## Summary
In this repo I apply different statistical and machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between Coronary Heart Disease and various features assocaited with it using a publicly available dataset. I use the Cleveland Heart Study dataset made available in the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). I hope to illustrate how machine learning techniques maybe used for inference and association.
